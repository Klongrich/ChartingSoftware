# ChartingSoftware
Attempting to make a fully open source stock trading software. Most code is pulled and edited from a 3 year old project called "JavaStockProject" located on my git.

What happened was back in 2017 Yahoo discontinued their API causing my whole system to break. I had to switch APIs and since then have been able to find newer APIs that work rather well.

Another issue is that with Java since I'm doing the front-end from scratch without charting libs I have to make different configurations for each OS. Windows, Mac, and Linux all run it a little differently.

I also had poor documentation on my last project. When I say poor I mean literally none. I will be slowly documenting each part of the software as I now realize it's importance.
